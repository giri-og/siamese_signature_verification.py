Siamese Network for Signature Verification  This project implements a Siamese Neural Network using PyTorch to verify signatures. It uses a CNN backbone to extract features from grayscale images, applies contrastive loss, and trains on genuine and forged signature pairs. The trained model helps distinguish between authentic and fake signatures.
